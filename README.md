The objective of this assignment is to apply the Linear Regression machine learning algorithm to predict salary based on the number of years of experience. By utilizing a dataset that includes employees' years of experience and corresponding salaries, the goal is to build an accurate regression model that can estimate the salary for new employees based on their years of experience. Through this assignment, I aim to achieve the following objectives:

•	Gain a practical understanding of the Linear Regression algorithm and its application in predicting continuous variables.
•	Acquire proficiency in splitting the dataset into training and testing sets for model evaluation and validation.
•	Implement the Linear Regression algorithm using appropriate libraries such as Pandas and sklearn.
•	Visualize and analyze the model's predictions through scatter plots to assess its accuracy.
•	Evaluate the performance of the Linear Regression model using suitable metrics like mean squared error (MSE) and R-squared.

•	Dataset:
The dataset is provided in a CSV file named "Salary_Data.csv". It contains two columns: "YearsExperience" (input feature) and "Salary" (output variable). The dataset consists of 29 samples.

•	Procedure for the Execution of the work:
1. Open Jupyter-lab and creates a file named “Predict”. Inside this file I have upload the data sheet “ Salary_Data.csv” and create a python file named “salarypredict.ipynb”.
2. Import the necessary libraries.
3. Import the Dataset and extract dependent and independent variables.
4. Visualizing the Dataset.
5. Splitting the dataset into the Training set and Test set.
6. Fitting Simple Linear Regression to the Training set.
7. Predicting the Test set results.
8. Visualizing the Training set result.
9. Visualizing the Test set result.
10. Finding the Residuals.
